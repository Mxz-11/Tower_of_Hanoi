# 🗼 Towers of Hanoi Automaton (Flex & Bison)

This project implements an automaton-based solver for the **Towers of Hanoi** puzzle with 3 disks and 3 pegs. It uses **Flex** for lexical analysis and **Bison** for syntax parsing to process a custom-defined input format representing state transitions.

## 📦 Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `th_plantilla.l` | Flex definition (scanner) to tokenize the automaton input. |
| `th_plantilla.y` | Bison grammar (parser) to build the automaton and compute shortest paths. |
| `y.tab.c / y.tab.h` | Generated by Bison – parser implementation and token definitions. |
| `lex.yy.c` | Generated by Flex – lexical analyzer code. |

## 🧠 Overview

- Each **state** is a base-3 representation of the positions of 3 disks.
- There are **27 possible states** (`3³`) and transitions are stored in a **27x27 matrix**.
- The automaton builds and processes transitions via symbolic matrix multiplication.
- It computes the **shortest path (minimal number of moves)** between two given states.

## 🧪 Sample Input Format

Example of a transition (where disk movement goes from one peg to another):

123 -> 213 : M
Each line represents a transition from one state to another, labeled by a move name or symbol.

## ⚙️ How to Compile and Run

### 🔧 Requirements

- `flex`
- `bison`
- `gcc`

### 🛠️ Compilation

```bash
bison -d th_plantilla.y
flex th_plantilla.l
gcc y.tab.c lex.yy.c -o hanoi -lm
```

### ▶️ Execution

```bash
./hanoi < input.txt
```

Where input.txt contains your transition rules.

### 📚 Features

- Parses transitions and builds an adjacency matrix.
- Uses matrix multiplication to simulate automaton state transitions.
- Finds the shortest path (minimum number of moves) between any two valid states.
- Clean modular design with separation between parsing, scanning, and logic.

### 📁 Automaton Visualization

The optional file estados.pdf can be used to visualize the finite automaton representing all possible states and transitions of the Hanoi system.
